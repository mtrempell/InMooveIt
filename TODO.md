* Install missing motors (servos?) for elbows, shoulders, ...
* Redo the wiring for the arms, do cable management etc.
* If possible, find a solution for the bad (i.e. too loose/unresponsive) tension in fingers.
* One of the middle fingers isn't working (I believe?).
* Print-out and assemble missing parts for the inmoov robot.
* Add feedback-loop to the arm as required by ROS (need to do more research on this)
